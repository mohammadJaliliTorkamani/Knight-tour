# Knight Tour 
Knight tour problem solver using `c++`

## Define the problem
By [defenition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour), A knight's tour is a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once. If the knight ends on a square that is one knight's move from the beginning square (so that it could tour the board again immediately, following the same path), the tour is closed; otherwise, it is open.
